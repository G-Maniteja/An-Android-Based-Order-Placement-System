# An-Android-Based-Order-Placement-System

Online food ordering is the process of food delivery or takeout from a local restaurant or food cooperative through a web page or app. Much like ordering consumer goods online, many of these services allow customers to keep accounts with them in order to make frequent ordering convenient. A customer will search for a favourite food items in the restaurant, then he places an Order.

The “Android based Order Placement System” is very easy to use as it does not require any technical knowledge to understand this application. For restaurants, By using this project, it becomes easy for customers to place the orders and sales of the restaurants can also be increased because of using Data mining techniques to analyse the customers orders.

The languages and technologies i had used for developing this project are Android in Android Studio,PHP,Bootstrap,MySQL.

There are two parts in this project.
1.	Customer Related Modules
2.	Admin Related Modules
An Android Application is developed for customers and a Web Page is developed for Admin. For the app to be connected to the online database (MySQL), i used PHP files (See customer folder in PHP/foodorder folder).

In this project i had used the data mining techniques like Association Rule Mining using apriori Algorithm for suggesting the related items to the customer.
